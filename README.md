# Worten - Taxi & Limousine Commission Project

Welcome to our final project for the Data Analyst course! Our client, Worten, commissioned us to perform a comprehensive analysis of taxi and public transportation distribution across New York State. This included services like Uber, Lyft, Bolt, and others.

## Project Overview

Our goal was to understand the distribution patterns of these services and deliver actionable insights. Here's a breakdown of the tools and methodologies we used to achieve this:

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For initial data conversion and preliminary analysis.
- **SQL Server & Navicat**: For querying and managing the data.
- **R & Excel**: For in-depth data analysis and visualization.
- **Power BI**: To create an interactive and detailed dashboard.

### Approach

1. **Data Collection and Conversion**: We used Python to prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Data Management**: SQL Server and Navicat helped us efficiently manage and query the data.
3. **Analysis and Visualization**: R and Excel provided powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing the data.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Power BI allowed us to build a user-friendly and comprehensive dashboard to present our findings.

## Results

Our methodical approach enabled us to answer the client's questions effectively and deliver valuable insights through a well-designed dashboard. We hope this project provides a clear understanding of transportation patterns and aids in strategic decision-making.
